# Secure Login System Simulation - Conference/Orientation Guide

## How a Real Phishing Attack Works

1. The attacker sends a fake email that looks like it’s from a trusted source (like a bank, company, or service).
2. The email usually contains urgent language, asking the user to click a link or download an attachment.
3. The link leads to a fake website that looks almost identical to the real one.
4. The user is asked to enter sensitive information (like username, password, or credit card details).
5. The attacker collects this information and can use it for fraud or unauthorized access.

### Key Signs of Phishing Emails
- Suspicious sender address (slightly misspelled or unusual domain).
- Urgent or threatening language (“Your account will be locked!”).
- Links that don’t match the real website (hover to check).
- Poor grammar or spelling mistakes.
- Unexpected attachments.

## Preparing Your Secure Login System Simulation for a Conference/Orientation

- Create a clear, interactive demo that shows:
  - What a phishing email looks like (with examples).
  - How users can spot phishing attempts (highlighting suspicious elements).
  - How your secure login system protects against such attacks.
- Prepare a simple, visually engaging interface for your audience.
- Add educational content or tooltips explaining each step.

## Next Steps

To proceed, please decide:
- What programming language or framework do you want to use for the simulation (e.g., Python, JavaScript, web-based, etc.)?
- Do you want a web app, desktop app, or a simple script?
- Should the simulation include fake login attempts and feedback?

Let me know your preferences to continue building your demo!
